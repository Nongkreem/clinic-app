# 🏥 Online Patient Queue Management System (Senior Project)
The Clinic Booking System is a full-stack appointment management system developed with React.js (Frontend), Node.js/Express (Backend), MySQL (Database), and Docker Compose for easy setup and deployment.
The system supports 4 user roles: Head Nurse, Nurse, Doctor, and Patient.

## 📖 Project Background
Currently, Songklanagarind Vejvivat Hospital provides an online appointment system for patient convenience. However, the existing application does not fully meet user needs because most patients cannot assess which specialized service they should access, such as gynecology clinics. As a result, patients often prefer to book appointments by phone.
This phone-based method creates other issues, including delays, high call volumes for staff, and mismatched service selection by patients who are unsure of their symptoms. These problems can slow down treatment and affect overall clinic queue management.
This project aims to develop an online queue management system with an initial patient symptom assessment feature to help guide patients to the appropriate service. The system simplifies the booking process, improves patient convenience, reduces staff workload, and enhances clinic service efficiency and modernization in the digital era.
